## Callouts
<Callout type="warning">
* All registered callbacks are not unique identifiers for the callback, you need to pass the resource name and the side.
* e.g lib.promise.on('getData').
  instead you need to define it like this: lib.promise.on('tr_kit:server:getData').
  the callbacks are designed to be global and any one else can call them.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
* Runtime errors are caught and logged automatically.
* Automatically handles nil returns and multiple return values.
* Awaiting from the js will not block the runtime, you need to use the native `await` attr and synchronousing the function you are in.
