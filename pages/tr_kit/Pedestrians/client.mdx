# Client
Create your pedestrians with ease by pushing your args to the functions

## createSinglePed
```ts
createSinglePed({
  hash: number,
  coords: [number, number, number, number]
  scenario?: {
    name?: string,
    timeToLeave?: number,
    playIntroClip?: boolean
  },
  behavior?: {
    freeze?: boolean,
    oblivious?: boolean,
  }
},
  timeout?: number
): Promise<[number, number] | undefined>
```

### Parameters
* hash: the hash of the ped model
* coords: [x, y, z, w]
* scenario?:
  * name: the name of the scenario, see [List of scenario names](https://pastebin.com/6mrYTdQv) or visit update/update.rpf/common/data/ai/scenarios.meta

### Examples

```ts
import { createSinglePed } from '@trippler/tr_kit/client'

const [entityHandle, entityNetId] = await createSinglePed({
  hash: GetHashKey('mp_m_freemode_01'),
  coords: [123.45, 678.90, 123.45, 267.89],
})

console.log(entityHandle, entityNetId) /* number, number */
```

## destroyCreatedPed
```ts
destroyCreatedPed(netId: number, timeout?: number): boolean
```

---
### Parameters
* netId: The ped entity netid
* timeout?: The timeout in milliseconds to wait for the ped to be destroyed

---
### Returns
* success: Whether the ped was deleted or not

---
### Examples
```ts
import { destroyCreatedPed } from '@trippler/tr_kit/client'

const success = await destroyCreatedPed(65023)

## Callouts
<Callout type='info'>
* The module automatically destroys the created peds on the resource stop detection
* Please be aware that the client handle is different from the server handle and vice versa.
* Now we are no longer allowing to pass whether or not the entity should be networked or not since most of the time you are going to clear the entity after use.
