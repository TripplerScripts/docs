# callouts
<Callout type="warning">
* All registered callbacks are unique identifiers for the callback, you don't need to pass the resource name and the side.
* e.g lib.callback.register('tr_kit:server:getData').
  instead just do lib.callback.register('getData').
  for security reasons, the callbacks are designed to be local only and no one else can call them.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
* Runtime errors are caught and logged automatically.
* Automatically handles nil returns and multiple return values.
* Awaiting from the js will not block the runtime, you need to use the native `await` attr and synchronousing the function you are in.
