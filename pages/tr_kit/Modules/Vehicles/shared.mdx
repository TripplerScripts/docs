## Callouts
<Callouts type='info'>
* If you wonder how to get the entity id (the handle), you can use `NetworkGetEntityFromNetworkId(netId)` which it'll return the entity id.
* Also you can do the opposite by using `NetworkGetNetworkIdFromEntity` which will return the netId if it was networked.
* Now we stoped allowing to pass whether or not you want the create to be networked or not since most of the time you are going to clear the entity after use.
