### Callout
<Callout type='info'>
* The file you want to import must be defined atleast in the fxmanifest's file | files
* Requiring a file will automatically execute its content
* Don't include the extension of the file ('.lua') at the end of the path since we are already taking care of that.
* If the system could not find the path, please refer to your fxmanifest and copy how you defined that file that you are trying to require
* The file you want to require, it must be void so you can receive its content
</Callout>
